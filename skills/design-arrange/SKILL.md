  Improve layout composition, spatial hierarchy, and visual flow so interfaces
  feel intentional, scannable, and structurally coherent.

Recompose interface structure through stronger spatial hierarchy, alignment,
and rhythm so content is easier to scan and interactions feel deliberate.

## MANDATORY PREPARATION

Follow `/frontend-design` and its `Context Gathering Protocol` before any
design work.

- Design work must not proceed without confirmed context.
- Required context includes: target audience, primary use cases, and brand
  personality/tone.
- Context cannot be inferred from codebase structure or implementation details
  alone.
- Gather context in this order:
  1. Current instructions in the active thread.
  2. `.atlas/design.md`.
  3. `teach-design` (required on cold start).
- Stop condition: if the required context is still missing, STOP and run
  `teach-design` first. Do not continue this skill until context is
  confirmed.

## Diagnose Spatial Problems

Identify where arrangement currently fails users:

1. **Hierarchy and flow**:
   - Primary content does not stand out from supporting detail
   - Scanning path is unclear or visually noisy
   - Related items are separated while unrelated items are grouped

2. **Alignment and rhythm**:
   - Misaligned columns, baselines, or action rows
   - Inconsistent spacing scale inside repeated components
   - Abrupt transitions between dense and sparse regions

3. **Responsiveness and resilience**:
   - Layout breaks with long text, empty states, or mobile widths
   - Content reorders unpredictably at breakpoints
   - Interaction targets lose clarity when condensed

## Arrange with Intent

### Establish Structural Priorities

- Define what must be seen first, second, and third
- Group by task relevance, not just by data type
- Use proximity and whitespace to communicate relationships
- Reserve strong contrast and prominent placement for truly primary elements

### Build a Spatial System

- Use a consistent spacing scale; avoid arbitrary pixel values
- Anchor layout to a clear grid or column strategy
- Use deliberate asymmetry only when it strengthens emphasis
- Prevent nested container overload where simpler grouping works better

### Control Reading Flow

- Position headings close to owned content
- Keep action controls near affected content
- Break long vertical runs with meaningful sectional rhythm
- Reduce redundant wrappers that dilute hierarchy

### Responsive Arrangement

- Design mobile-first composition, then enhance for larger screens
- Use container-aware rules when component context changes
- Preserve order of importance when stacking content on small screens
- Keep touch targets and spacing usable under compression

## Edge-Case Stability

Validate arrangement under stress:

- Very long labels, user-generated text, and localization expansion
- Empty, loading, error, and partial-data states
- Extremely dense lists or cards with mixed content heights
- Keyboard navigation order and focus visibility in all layouts

## Arrangement Completion Checklist

- [ ] Primary-to-secondary hierarchy is obvious
- [ ] Spacing and alignment are system-consistent
- [ ] Reading and interaction flow are predictable
- [ ] Mobile and narrow layouts preserve intent
- [ ] Edge cases do not collapse structure or usability

**NEVER**:

- Rearrange solely for visual novelty without user benefit
- Solve hierarchy by adding more decoration or more containers
- Force symmetry when content semantics require asymmetry
- Treat responsive behavior as a post-hoc patch
- Ignore keyboard and focus flow when restructuring layout
