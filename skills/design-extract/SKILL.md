  Extract and consolidate reusable components, design tokens, and patterns
  into your design system. Identifies opportunities for systematic reuse and
  enriches your component library.

<!-- Adapted from pbakaus/impeccable (Apache 2.0) -- see NOTICE.md -->

Identify reusable patterns, components, and design tokens, then extract and
consolidate them into the design system for systematic reuse.

## MANDATORY PREPARATION

Follow `/frontend-design` and its `Context Gathering Protocol` before any
design work.

- Design work must not proceed without confirmed context.
- Required context includes: target audience, primary use cases, and brand
  personality/tone.
- Context cannot be inferred from codebase structure or implementation details
  alone.
- Gather context in this order:
  1. Current instructions in the active thread.
  2. `.atlas/design.md`.
  3. `teach-design` (required on cold start).
- Stop condition: if the required context is still missing, STOP and run
  `teach-design` first. Do not continue this skill until context is
  confirmed.

## Discover

Analyze the target area to identify extraction opportunities:

1. **Find the design system**: Locate your design system, component library,
   or shared UI directory (grep for "design system", "ui", "components",
   etc.). Understand its structure:
   - Component organization and naming conventions
   - Design token structure (if any)
   - Documentation patterns
   - Import/export conventions

   **CRITICAL**: If no design system exists, ask before creating one.
   Understand the preferred location and structure first.

2. **Identify patterns**: Look for:
   - **Repeated components**: Similar UI patterns used multiple times
     (buttons, cards, inputs, etc.)
   - **Hard-coded values**: Colors, spacing, typography, shadows that should
     be tokens
   - **Inconsistent variations**: Multiple implementations of the same concept
     (3 different button styles)
   - **Reusable patterns**: Layout patterns, composition patterns, interaction
     patterns worth systematizing

3. **Assess value**: Not everything should be extracted. Consider:
   - Is this used 3+ times, or likely to be reused?
   - Would systematizing this improve consistency?
   - Is this a general pattern or context-specific?
   - What's the maintenance cost vs benefit?

## Plan Extraction

Create a systematic extraction plan:

- **Components to extract**: Which UI elements become reusable components?
- **Tokens to create**: Which hard-coded values become design tokens?
- **Variants to support**: What variations does each component need?
- **Naming conventions**: Component names, token names, prop names that match
  existing patterns
- **Migration path**: How to refactor existing uses to consume the new shared
  versions

**IMPORTANT**: Design systems grow incrementally. Extract what's clearly
reusable now, not everything that might someday be reusable.

## Extract & Enrich

Build improved, reusable versions:

- **Components**: Create well-designed components with:
  - Clear props API with sensible defaults
  - Proper variants for different use cases
  - Accessibility built in (ARIA, keyboard navigation, focus management)
  - Documentation and usage examples

- **Design tokens**: Create tokens with:
  - Clear naming (primitive vs semantic)
  - Proper hierarchy and organization
  - Documentation of when to use each token

- **Patterns**: Document patterns with:
  - When to use this pattern
  - Code examples
  - Variations and combinations

**NEVER**:

- Extract one-off, context-specific implementations without generalization
- Create components so generic they're useless
- Extract without considering existing design system conventions
- Skip proper TypeScript types or prop documentation
- Create tokens for every single value (tokens should have semantic meaning)

## Migrate

Replace existing uses with the new shared versions:

- **Find all instances**: Search for the patterns you've extracted
- **Replace systematically**: Update each use to consume the shared version
- **Test thoroughly**: Ensure visual and functional parity
- **Delete dead code**: Remove the old implementations

## Document

Update design system documentation:

- Add new components to the component library
- Document token usage and values
- Add examples and guidelines
- Update any Storybook or component catalog

Remember: A good design system is a living system. Extract patterns as they
emerge, enrich them thoughtfully, and maintain them consistently.
